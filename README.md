# Lesmor
Lesmor is an asymmetrical team-based Minecraft PVP map with a round-based economy.

The game is played by two teams. A team wins a match upon winning 10 rounds. A team wins a round when all players on the other team are eliminated, or when they capture the point in the center.

Based on in-game objectives, teams gain currency which can be spent on upgrades that are either semi-persistent (structures) or temporary (powerups).
